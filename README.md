Predicting Income using Adult Census data

This project reports the analysis and exploration of the Adult Census Dataset and classifies the income
levels of people using various demographic, social and economic features. Various Machine Learning
techniques are employed to analyze the features present in the dataset. The dependency of income on
each of these features is measured and this information is used to predict the income with the help of
suitable algorithms.
